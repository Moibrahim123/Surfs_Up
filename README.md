## Compare findings between the month of June and December.


W. Avy likes our analysis, but he felt there was one piece of information missing: seasonal data. He asked us to gather data on the seasons of Oahu and determine whether the seasons could affect the surf and ice cream shop business. Specifically, are there certain times of the year when business might be slower, or the type of customer could be different?

In this challenge, we found a few key aspects of Oahuâ€™s seasonal weather data by determining key statistical data about the month of July and the month of December. We returned the minimum, average, and maximum temperatures of the range of dates for June 2015, June 2016, June 2017, December 2015, December 2016, and December 2017. We, also, designed a query to retrieve the month of precipitation data and plot the results for each of those range or dates. 

While, also, using the describe () function to identify the key statistical data. The describe () function shows a downward trend in precipitation for the month of June. June 2015 max precipitation 2.47, June 2016 max precipitation 1.70, June 2017 max precipitation 1.69. While, December appears to be increasing. December 2015 max precipitation 2.21, December 2016 max precipitation 2.37, December 2017 max precipitation is NaN.



## Recommendation 


Although, June and December are great snap-shots into the seasons, I would recommend going through each month for weather trends throughout the year and compare year to year.

Charts are a great visual tool. I would use a pie charts to visualize the weather trends throughout the year and a line chart for year over year. With each line having its own unique color it would be easy to identify any trends.

Weather is a key component in any business. However, it would be worth a look at sales of the merchandise we plan to sale. Information on the most popular surf board size or favorite ice cream flavor within our community and current trends could help control shrinkage and push for sales. Shrinkage would be controlled by not over ordering. Knowing what the customer wants help us avoid a pricey surf board collecting dust and ice cream, which is a perishable item, from spoiling.
